# microservices-python-react

This project demonstrates how we can build a simple python application using distributed frameworks and microservices architectural pattern.
The main components of this project are as follows-
  1. Docker - For Containerization
  2. Django REST Framework - For building lightweight microservices
  3. Django Framework - For building the complete application as Python BE
  4. Flask Framework - For building lightweight microservices
  5. React JS Framework - For building the FE of the application
  
  
 This project follows the instructions from the freeCodeCamp.org Video located here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iB5IPoTDts

 This project is intended to be a companion guide for learners so they can pull the repository and run the code on their machines to see how it works.
